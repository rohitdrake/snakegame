After reading the article "How to become hacker?"
by Eric S Raymond, I decided to follow the ideas
mentioned in the article.
Eric Suggests to read and understand well written code.
Code should be of programe in which you are interested.
After reading and understanding code try to add some feature.
I did the same. After reading code, I added pause feature 
which was missing in this game.
